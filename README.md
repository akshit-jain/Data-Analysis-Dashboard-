# Data-Analysis-Dashboard-


I have used MySQL workbench and Power BI to create a dashboard which provides critical analysis on the sales and revenue generated by the company.





The data is sourced from a SQL file to Power BI through MySQL server.




Data is analysed and cleaned by using filter in Power BI.




After the data transforming is finished, to create the dashboard, we need to first define some base measures.





The two bases measures that I have defined are Revenue and Sales Quantity.




Thanks to codebasics for the dataset and teachings.









The DAX language formulas used for generating the base measures in Power BI are as follows:



Revenue = SUM('sales transactions'[normalized_curr])







Sales Qty = SUM('sales transactions'[sales_qty])
